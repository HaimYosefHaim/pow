            <h1> mbedTLS ECDSA example</h1>
                <div>
                    <p> This example uses hardware accelerators of the supported devices to perform ECDSA digital signature
		                with mbedTLS. </p>
                </div>

            <h2> Getting started </h2>
                <div>
                    <p> Build the example and flash it to a supported device. Open a terminal emulator to see the output
                        and give required user option input.</p>

                    <p> When starting the application, the user will get three options, that are the three supported curves
                        for the ECDSA algorithm. The user has to press <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> indicating
                        which curve to use. If a valid option is chosen, the application will write to serial output when it has
                        performed each step in the process. The example application is also programmed to measure the time spent
                        in each step of the algorithm.</p>

             		<h3>To turn off the HW acceleration </h3>
      		            <p> To check the performance gain of the hardware acceleration, the user can switch it off. This is done by
                            switching the value of <b>Enable hardware acceleration of crypto operations</b> in the component <i>Mbed TLS
                            common functionality</i>. This is found under the tab <i>SOFTWARE COMPONENTS</i> &rarr; <i>Platform
                            &rarr; Security</i>. </p>

                     <p> <b>Useful tip:</b> Tick the boxes of <i>Configurable Components</i> and <i>Installed Components</i> to
                     find the configuration file more easily. </p>
                 </div>

            <h2>Additional info </h2>
                <div>
                    <p> The example uses the CTR-DRBG, a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) included in mbedTLS to generate the
              			key pair for the user. If the example is running on a device including a TRNG hardware module (True Random
              			Nuber Generator) the TRNG will be used as entropy source to seed the CTR-DRBG. If the device does not incorporate a TRNG, the example will use RAIL as the entropy source. If neither of them are incorporated, a dummy data will be seeded to the CTR-DRBG.
                        The entropy accumulator of mbedTLS will use SHA256 to hash the the entropy data pool which is filled with data from the entropy
              			sources.</p>

                    <p> The CTR-DRBG involve use of AES which is accelerated by the CRYPTO AES accelerator.</p>

                    <p> The entropy accumulator of mbedTLS is setup to use SHA-256 which is accelerated by the
                        CRYPTO SHA-256 accelerator.</p>

                    <p> The example redirects standard I/O to the VCOM virtual serial port.The user can use a
                        terminal emulator program to connect to the serial port with the default settings of 115200-8-N-1.</p>

                    <p> The program asks the user to choose between three supported curves. The available
                        curves with hardware acceleration support are:</p>

            <ul>
                 <li>SECP256R1</li>
                 <li>SECP192R1</li>
            </ul>
