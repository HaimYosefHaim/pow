            <h1> mbedTLS AES example</h1>
                <div>
                     <p> This example uses hardware accelerators of the supported devices to perform AES encryption and
	                     decryption on the supported device.</p>
                </div>

    	    <h2> Getting started </h2>
                <div>
                     <p> Build the example and flash it to a supported device. Open a terminal emulator and follow the
        		         the instructions shown on the console.</p>

                     <p> When starting the application, the user will get the option to run the program in encryption mode or
		                 decryption mode.</p>

         	         <p> In ecryption mode, the example will ask the user for a short phrase to generate an initial vector
                   	     used in the AES encryption process. The user may type any phrase ended by newline or limited to a maximum
                   	     of 16 bytes. After the short phrase, the user should start typing in the message to be encrypted, followed
                   	     by a newline to mark the end of the message. The message length is limited to the #define
                   	     MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_ENCRYPTION. Then the program will encrypt the message (plaintext), and print out the
                   	     ciphertext, preceded with the initial vector of 16 bytes and followed by a message digest tag of 32 bytes.
                   	     All data is converted to hexadecimal readable text format before sent to the serial port.
                     <p> The format is:</p>
                     <p> Initial Vector(16 bytes) | Ciphertext | Message Digest Tag (32 bytes)</p>

		             <p> The user can copy the output and feed it back to the program for decryption later. The user need to
                 		 reset the kit in order to run decryption mode.</p>

            		 <p> In decryption mode, the example will expect to receive a decrypted message in the same format as
        	    	     generated by the encryption.</p>

                     <h3> To turn off the HW acceleration</h3>
                         <p> To check the performance gain of the hardware acceleration, the user can switch it off. This is done by
                             switching the value of <b>Enable hardware acceleration of crypto operations</b> in the component <i>Mbed TLS
                             common functionality</i>. This is found under the tab <i>SOFTWARE COMPONENTS</i> &rarr; <i>Platform
                             &rarr; Security</i>. </p>

                     <p><b>Useful tip:</b> Tick the boxes of <i>Configurable Components</i> and <i>Installed Components</i> to
                         find the configuration file more easily. </p>
                </div>

		    <h2> Additional info </h2>
                <div>
                     <p> The AES is operations are accelerated by the CRYPTO AES accelerator.</p>
                     <p> The SHA operations are accelerated by the CRYPTO SHA-256 accelerator.</p>
                     <p> The example redirects standard I/O to the VCOM virtual serial port.The user can use a
                         terminal emulator program to connect to the serial port with the default settings of 115200-8-N-1.</p>
