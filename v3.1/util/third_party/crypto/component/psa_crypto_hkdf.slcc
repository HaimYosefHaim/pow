label: PSA Crypto support for HKDF
description:
  "This component provides support for key derivation using HKDF in PSA Crypto.\n

  At the moment the 'Mbed TLS Support for HKDF' component is required  \
  (automatically included) for HKDF operation via the PSA Crypto key derivation \
  APIs. Hardware acceleration of HKDF is only supported on Vault devices and \
  only for opaque keys but cannot operate standalone (currently), without the \
  'Mbed TLS Support for HKDF' component which also provides suppport for HKDF \
  with plaintext keys on all devices using the classic mbedTLS libraries."
